# Patatap using spooky sounds.

My Love for horror movies and them spooky little sounds was the inspiration in creating a Patatap clone using all the different scary sounds. 

Just press any Alphabet key to test it out.

Used:
Paper.js
Howler.js

  Created in the Full stack bootcamp

thanks to https://github.com/Schlenges for the sounds and inspiration

1. Sounds recording facility
2. Disable previous sounds when a new key is pressed
